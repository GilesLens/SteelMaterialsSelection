# Steel Materials Selection

This project was done for PT. Komatsu Indonesia in order to help accelerate the process of materials selection for their heavy machinery and equipment. Since the impact of the war in Ukraine and Russia, global supply chain for steel has been disrupted and caused Komatsu Indonesia to lack in terms of substitue steel materials for their heavy machinery. Hence, they tasked this project to
  
  1. Create a database of new substitute steel materials 
  2. Create a simple program that can give substitute steel materials from the database to replace their input steel with specific properties

Program used in this case is a K-Nearest Neighbour Machine Learning algorithm due to the size of the database (as it is quite small, ~100 entries) and the nature of the task.

Code packages: Scikit-learn (for algorithm), Pandas (data manipulation and visualization), Python (codebase).
